8.10 -> when creating new stuff with mutations, there's atleast 2 ways to keep stuff up to date:
	pollInterval: poll every x seconds if things have changed, pros: consistent data for all users, cons: bandwidth
	refetchQueries: refetch select queries when adding. pros and cons are opposite of pollInterval :D
