Will start using temporary README's to document progress and plan stuff.

-5.7 => let's implement a togglable blog. We can click a button to see more.
	Apparently there is difficulty using our already defined Toggle component
	, so I'll try adding state to the very basic Blog<> one. :)
        Done. basically another Toggle component.
 
-5.8 =>	updating likes part of blog. Need to update entire blog part.
        HTTP PUT in blogService.js, (and backend?), BACKEND FIXED 
	I'll also refactor LoginForm (states and eventHandlers), nope, this seems redundant, will break something
	like button works, but one needs to refresh the page for it to work... hmmm
